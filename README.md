# Python_loops
     for loop
        for item in list_of_items:
           Do something to each item
          e.g. 1
               fruits = ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
               for fruit in fruits:                 # fruit is name of each individual itemm ; "fruits" is the list to loop thru
                 print(fruit)
         e.g. 2
               fruits = ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
               for fruit in fruits:                 # fruit is name of each individual itemm ; "fruits" is the list to loop thru
                 print (fruit)
                 print(fruit + "Pie")
                 print(fruits)
        ouput:
             Apple
             Apple Pie
             ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
             
             Peach
             Peach Pie
             ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
             
             Pear
             Pear Pie
             ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
             
        NOTE: Indentation is really important, for e.g. in code above, the indentation means that the code is within the for loop, these codes will carry on as many times as the for loop needs to repeat
        e.g. 3 
        fruits = ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
               for fruit in fruits:                 # fruit is name of each individual itemm ; "fruits" is the list to loop thru
                 print (fruit)
                 print(fruit + "pie")
               print(fruits)
        output:
               Apple
               Apple pie
               Peach
               Peach pie
               Pear pie
               ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]
